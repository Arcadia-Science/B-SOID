## DLC_PREPROCESS.m

```matlab
function [data_rect,perc_rect] = dlc_preprocess(data,llh)
```

### Prior to Usage
*Make sure you run the following to remove headers and/or convert from table into a matrix containing just the x and y positions. Also, organize the data structure corresponding to the columns and rows following the `DATA` description below.*
For example, in MATLAB, working with the .csv file generated by DeepLabCut 2.0:
```matlab
fprintf('Please select DeepLabCut generated .csv file. \n'); 
[filecsv,pathcsv] = uigetfile; 
filenamecsv = sprintf('%s%s',pathcsv,filecsv);
data_struct = importdata(filenamecsv); rawdata{i} = data_struct.data;
```

#### Inputs to DLC_PREPROCESS.m

- `DATA`    6-body parts (x,y) matrix outlining the mouse viewed from bottom-up. Rows represents frame numbers. Columns 1 & 2: Snout; Columns 3, 4, 5 & 6: two front paws (Left-Right order does not matter); Columns 7, 8, 9 & 10: two hind paws (Left-Right order does not matter); Columns 11 & 12: base of tail (Place it where the tail extends out from the butt). 

  - Last tested on 071219, using data generated by DeepLabCut 2.0, with outlier (jump) frames at 0.3%.

- `LLH`    Likelihood threshold cut-off. User should base this on how the labeled videos from DeepLabCut looks. Default is 0.5.Video sampling frame rate. Use *VideoReader* in MATLAB or *ffmpeg* bash command to detect.  

#### Outputs of DLC_PREPROCESS.m

- `DATA_RECT`    Data matrix rectified after low-pass filter replacing the value with the most recent confident x,y.
- `PERC_RECT`    Percent rectified for each body part.  This is just to inform the user how much data is below the threshold. Consider retraining/refining the network if this value is above 15%.
